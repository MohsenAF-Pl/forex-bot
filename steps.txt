actually you can run b_saveCandles to get latest data

if you want to do this project for tehran market you need to do it from a to whatever it goes to
and you need to use "D1" obviously for granularity and rewrite the a_instrument


write something so it can be checked for the existing data/candles and the 
last time/candles you have the script get the rest of it not do everything
all over again


in the InsideBar_insidebarexplore file there is a major problem in geting the signal
if he didnot fix you must do InsideBar_insidebarexplore
